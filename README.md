## 💙 Same Colour, More Control
Cerulean is what you wish Azure could be. An expansive collection of microservices, pre-configured systems,
and entirely self-hosted! Cerulean is built using NixOS as a foundation so you know it's never going to break randomly.
NixOS backing makes Cerulean **extremely scalable**! Just rent a new VPS and Cerulean will build an ISO of your configuration.

No stress, no hassle!
Say goodbye to Azure! And say goodbye to Kubernetes! You're taking life into your own hands 💙

### 🌌 🚀 Nexus
Cerulean allows you to declare *"Nexus Networks"*, virtual networks of servers that Cerulean can manage.
Each Nexus is **very powerful**. Allowing for simple distributed computing, automatic construction of a wireguard
VPN, distributed DNS for local hostnames, and that's just scratching the surface...
